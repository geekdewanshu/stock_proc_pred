DVC (Data Version Control) is an open-source version control system for managing machine learning projects, specifically designed to handle large datasets, models, and experiment tracking.
Key Concepts
Version Control for Data & Models

Works alongside Git to track large files that Git can't handle efficiently
Stores data/model files externally (cloud storage, remote servers)
Keeps lightweight pointers in Git repositories

Core Features

Data versioning: Track changes to datasets like you track code
Pipeline management: Define and reproduce ML workflows
Experiment tracking: Compare model performance across runs
Remote storage: Store large files in S3, Google Drive, Azure, etc.
